# rust-discord-bot-tutorial
A hands-on project for building and deploying a Discord bot using Rust. This repo walks through setup, coding with Serenity and Tokio, and cloud deployment with Railway or Render. Created as part of my Rust learning journey to explore real-world async programming and API integration.
